Single HTML page Kanji Matching game

The goal here is to make a small game in JavaScript that can be run by just grabbing the files and opening the base HTML file in a modern web browser.

This app uses the KANJIDIC2 XML file for its datasource.

The file itself is available from the [KANJIDIC2 project page](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/).
The version I am using is also available in the kanjidic2 directory/folder.
